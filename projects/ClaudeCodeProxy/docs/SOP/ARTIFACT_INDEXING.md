# Artifact Indexing SOP

Goal: keep a single, easy‑to‑scan list of key artifacts so reviewers can jump fast.

Where
- `docs/integration/DUAL_AGENT/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md`

What to index
- Commits (repo, branch, short SHA)
- Bundles (~/Downloads/*.zip)
- Evidence (usage.json, metrics.prom, summary.json)
- Endpoints touched (for quick probing)

Rules
- Append only; don’t delete old entries.
- Use repo‑relative paths when possible.
