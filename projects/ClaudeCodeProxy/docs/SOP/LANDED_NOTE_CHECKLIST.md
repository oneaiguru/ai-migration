# Landed Note Checklist

When you finish a slice, append a “landed” note to the shared CHAT.md including:

Required
- Changed paths (code, docs, tests) with repo‑relative paths
- Exact commands to reproduce results (copy‑paste block)
- Artifacts: bundles, usage/metrics snapshots, summaries (paths)
- Commit IDs and branch name

Recommended
- Short TL;DR of changes (bullets)
- Next steps + owner
