# System Docs (Draft)

This directory will eventually mirror the richer structure used in `~/git/tools/agentos/docs/System`—covering architecture, operations, methodologies, quality, and reporting. For now it’s a placeholder so we can start organizing long-lived reference material outside of SOPs or feature-specific plans.

## Next Steps
- Populate remaining subdirectories (scheduler, reporting, etc.) as they become relevant.
- Borrow/adapt proven docs from the agentos repo (e.g., `~/git/tools/agentos/docs/System`, `~/git/tools/agentos/docs/System/CE_MAGIC_PROMPTS`).
- Public prompts now live locally at `docs/System/CE_MAGIC_PROMPTS/PLAN-USING-MAGIC-PROMPT.md` (copied for convenience).
- Integration ideas captured in `docs/System/integration/ccc-agentos-integration.md` should be expanded as projects converge.
- Logging retention knobs documented in `docs/System/logging-retention.md`.
- Keep the main docs index (`docs/README.md`) updated when new system docs arrive.

See `docs/System/TODO.md` for the initial backlog.
