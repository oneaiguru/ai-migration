# System Docs Backlog

Reference: `~/git/tools/agentos/docs/System` (mature structure we can draw from).

## Candidates to port/adapt
- **Operations** – environment profiles, smoke-test SOP integration, deployment guardrails.
- **Methodologies** – planning/next-agent briefs aligned with `docs/Tasks/mitm_strip_thinking.plan.md`.
- **Quality** – add acceptance gate summaries and shellcheck requirements.
- **Scheduler** – document how/when to run smoke tests and UAT windows once profiles are in daily use.
- **Reporting** – lightweight churn/usage reporting mirroring `agentos/docs/System/reporting`.
- **Contracts/Policies** – cross-provider ToS notes, credential handling policies.
- **CE Magic Prompts** – ✅ `docs/System/CE_MAGIC_PROMPTS/PLAN-USING-MAGIC-PROMPT.md` copied (expand set as needed).

## Immediate to-dos (updated)
1. ✅ `docs/System/operations/environment-profiles.md` (done).
2. ✅ `docs/System/quality/checklist.md` (done).
3. ✅ `docs/System/methodologies/long-session.md` (done).
4. Decide whether the thinking-sanitizer plan graduates to a System methodology once implemented.

Update this backlog as soon as new documents land.
