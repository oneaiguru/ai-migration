**Q:** Why subagents first?
**A:** They’re separate contexts; clean to route; no cache confusion.

**Q:** Can we do `/model haiku` mid-session and route to Z.AI?
**A:** Possibly, but only after we solve host retargeting/H2 reliably.

**Q:** Do we need LLM Gateway?
**A:** Not for subscription lanes. Keep gateway for API‑key flows only.
