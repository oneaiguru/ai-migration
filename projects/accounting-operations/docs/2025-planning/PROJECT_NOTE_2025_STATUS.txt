# 2025 Coverage & Overflow Accounting (Project Note)

## Current 2025 Status

| Account | 2025 Range | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| KGS-BIZ-3967 | 24.12.2024 - 29.04.2025 | ✅ Partial (Jan-Apr) |

## Overflow Accounting

**2024→2025 statements are acceptable:**
- ✅ Standard banking practice (quarters don't align with calendars)
- ✅ No double-counting (each day in one year only)
- ✅ For annual reports: Dec portions → 2024 total; Jan-Feb portions → 2025 total

**For 2025 Annual Report (Jan 2026):**
- 3 of 4 accounts have partial coverage (good start)
- EUR needs full year (Q1-Q4)
- Others need remaining quarters (Q2-Q4)
