# v1.3 Legacy Package (Outdated)

This folder archives the v1.3 documentation and parser assets so we can reference prior thinking without polluting the active v1.6 workspace.

## Contents
- `PRD_v1.3_subscription_usage_tracker.md` — original PRD text captured from the `13.markdown` handoff.
- `parser_test_plan.md` — requirements summary extracted from `13bdd.md`.
- `tests/bdd/features/` — legacy Codex and Claude Gherkin features.
- `tests/bdd/steps/` — illustrative step definitions.
- `tracker/sources/` — reference parser implementations.

All files are frozen snapshots and should **not** be executed without updating them to match the current PRD. They exist to show how the project evolved from v1.3 to the current v1.6 baseline.
