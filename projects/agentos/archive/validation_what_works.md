# ✅ What You Got RIGHT - Strong Foundations

## 1. Core Economic Insight is BRILLIANT
Your subscription vs API cost analysis is spot-on:
- **Correct observation**: Subscriptions win at scale when properly utilized
- **Smart framing**: Cost per successful feature (not just $/token)
- **Right metric**: Features shipped per unit of capacity

## 2. Multi-Agent Short Cycles - Excellent Reasoning
The token economics math checks out:
- Naive approach: 500k tokens (wasteful)
- Your approach: 56k tokens (9x more efficient)
- **Key insight**: Fresh context per step prevents drift

## 3. Measurement Approach is Solid
Converting heterogeneous units to common metric is correct:
- Features per % of weekly bar (Codex/Claude)
- Features per prompt quota (GLM)
- Then normalize to $/feature

## 4. Statistical Framework
Good instincts on:
- Using confidence intervals
- Bandit optimization for continuous learning
- Elimination of dominated options

## 5. Practical Implementation Plan
Week 0 baseline → Week 1 expansion → Production is sensible

## 6. Portfolio Optimization Framing
Treating this as a constraint optimization problem with:
- Monthly costs
- Weekly capacities  
- Quality profiles
This is the right abstraction level.

## What This Validates:
- You understand the economics deeply
- You've identified a real market gap (no tools handle subscription optimization)
- Your measurement protocol is actionable
- The business case is compelling ($30k-80k savings at scale)
