Source: archive/deepresearch/2025-10-18/deep_research_2025-10-18_J_execute_with_magic_prompt.md

## Navigation Index
- L1: File header
- L3: Execution magic prompt mandate
- L9: Rule 1 — Use existing patterns
- L18: Rule 2 — Create facades over rebuilds
- L27: Rule 3 — Templates over algorithms
- L36: Rule 4 — Test with real data
- L45: Rule 5 — Document with message files
- L54: Argus reality check
- L68: Execution principles
- L79: Message file pattern
- L100: Critical rules recap

## Highlights
- L9–53: Five execution guardrails emphasise reuse, wrappers, configuration-driven behaviour, real-data validation, and message-file documentation.
- L54–67: “Argus reality check” cements the non-ML, rule-based constraints (predefined templates, Russian compliance terms, keep it simple).
- L79–99: Mandated message-file pattern details handoff structure for multi-agent workflows.
- L100–113: Critical rules reiterate simplicity, reuse, immediate testing, and explicit documentation of decisions.

## Next Actions
- Reference this summary in executor SOPs and `docs/Tasks/tracker_phase2_executor.md` so implementation agents follow the mandated structure.
- Add tooling (linting or checklist) to confirm message-files are produced when execution phases finish.
- Cross-link with planning magic prompt summary to keep PLAN/EXECUTE patterns aligned in onboarding docs.
