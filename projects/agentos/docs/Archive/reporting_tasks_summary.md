# Reporting Tasks Overview — Line-Indexed Summary
Source: archive/deepresearch/2025-10-18/reporting_tasks.md

## Navigation Index
- L1: Deep Research follow-up tracker
- L5: Source → deliverable matrix
- L16: Immediate actions checklist
- L22: Maintenance reminder

## Highlights
- L5–14: Table maps each deep-research artifact to its next deliverable (status update, telemetry spec, prompt adoption checks, cost analysis, experiment log, vendor decision memo, LiteLLM prototype).
- L16–20: Immediate priorities—collect cc.sh/claude-trace artifacts, finish Week-0 tooling (tracker CLI + monitors), and draft analytics report templates.

## Next Actions
- Convert the table rows into discrete TODO items (with owners) inside `docs/Tasks/` to ensure each research deliverable is tracked.
- Close the Week-0 tooling action by verifying ccusage + claude-monitor integrations in the tracker repository.
- Draft analytics templates (break-even, churn integration, LiteLLM prototype) and link them back here so the tracker stays current.
