# Backlog Index — Autonomy & Measurement (v1)

Use this index to navigate high‑impact improvements that turn our tracker into a reliable measurement platform. Each item has a short brief, a suggested diagram, contracts (deps/outputs), a token budget, and a link to a full spec stub.

Notes
- Keep docs flat; each spec is a single Markdown file; diagrams are simple Mermaid or ASCII.
- Token budgets are estimates for planning against the 70–80% window target.
- Review `docs/Backlog/anti_patterns.md` before implementation to avoid conflicting with SOP/DoD.

## Quick Wins (high value, low effort)
- `Backlog/progressive_nav_generator.md`
- `Backlog/plan_compiler.md`
- `Backlog/token_estimator_governor.md`
- `Backlog/scenario_harvester.md`
- `Backlog/snapshot_restore_state.md`
