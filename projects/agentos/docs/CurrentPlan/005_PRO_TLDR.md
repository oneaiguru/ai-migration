**Read First:**
`docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` · `docs/SOP/uat_opener.md` · `docs/SOP/decision_card.md` · `docs/System/capability_map/agentos/capabilities.csv`

**Run:**
1. Pre-flight (pytest, behave, preview `W0-CHP`, decision card `W0-CHP`).
2. Phase A/B/C follow-ups (automation pack, multi-agent docs/tests, BDD parity).
3. Open new Codex window (`W0-N`), deliver 2–3 micro tasks, append evidence after each, run AFTER (+5), finalize, churn, decision.

**Scope:** Codex lane only. **No proxy/remote ingest.**

**Success:**
- `W0-CHP` confirmed GO (decision recorded).
- New window closed clean with *Anomalies: 0*, evidence rows, updated ledgers, and decision card output.
- Automation docs/tests/BDD updates merged (AGENT_ID guidance, undo scenarios, decision card coverage).
