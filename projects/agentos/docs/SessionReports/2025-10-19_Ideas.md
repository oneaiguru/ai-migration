# Session Ideas – 2025-10-19

## Telemetry & Measurement
- Unified timeline builder for aliases, ccusage, monitor, codex events → timeline.json
- Append-only JSONL ledgers for tasks, features, sessions, anomalies (with tool/schema versions)
- Stats & power analysis to show CI, n, and power in preview
- What-if efficiency estimator for provider splits; guard low-n (<3)
- Token estimator & governor (advisory warnings, not blocking)
- Codex exec --json event sink (under .gitignore, optional redaction)
- Telemetry extensions: message counts, error taxonomy, latency metrics
- Scenario harvester + coverage map + plan lint (spec-first enforcement)

## Automation & Capture
- Codex `/status` automation script (exec → resume → /status → /quit) with ADR-004 buffer
- ccusage-codex coverage for daily/weekly/session tokens; preview lines
- Launchd scheduler (opt-in) for periodic status/ccusage captures
- Snapshot/restore script for tracker state (separate live vs test)
- Operator wrappers (start/close window) to bundle snapshot, governor, bundle
- Deliverables bundler (plan + TLDR + ledgers + timeline in one zip)

## Routing & Experiments
- Bandit roadmap: ε-greedy → Thompson → BwK with replay validation
- Experiment designs: cross-over, time-stratified, difficulty-matched tagging
- Unified taskset.jsonl with difficulty & acceptance criteria for fair comparisons

## Docs & Summaries
- Progressive NAV generator (headings → L indexes → highlights)
- Recipes for ccusage ingest, codex status capture, progressive summary, bundler
- Brainstorming SOP (capture → triage → spec → budget)
- Backlog naming SOP + glossary of controlled terms

## Guardrails & Anti-Patterns
- Token governor warnings only (provide `--force` override)
- Plan compiler placeholders must be replaced before calling DoD complete
- Drift watchdog thresholds + ignore lists to prevent noise; human in the loop
- Launchd scheduler optional; document disable path
- No hard-coded reset times; infer `reset_at` via timeline; codex 5h uses minute-level rolling windows
- Keep docs flat; avoid deep nesting
- Local repo security posture: event logs under .gitignore; optional secure mode later
