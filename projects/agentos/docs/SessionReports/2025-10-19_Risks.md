# Session Risks & Mitigations – 2025-10-19

- **Provider drift**: Codex/ccusage/monitor output changes → Mitigation: maintain fixtures, drift watchdog with thresholds + manual approval, tool_version field.
- **Reset edges**: Stale “after” snapshots near reset → Mitigation: enforce ADR-004 buffer, record `reset_at`, rely on timeline.
- **Low-n routing**: Poor decisions when data sparse → Mitigation: What-if estimator requires n≥3; CI shows n/power; bandit phases gated by replay.
- **Automation collisions**: Launchd vs manual scripts → Mitigation: wrappers check lock files; scheduler opt-in; document disable flag.
- **Spec drift**: Plan compiler may leave placeholders → Mitigation: DoD requires removal; plan coverage lint ensures real spec.
- **Ledger churn**: JSONL growth → Mitigation: daily rotation, optional compress; snapshots before tests.
- **Operator bias**: Single operator results skewed → Mitigation: record operator_id (optional), rotate task/provider order via experiment design.
- **Latency of preview**: Large JSONL slows preview → Mitigation: add index files, tail mode, timeline summary.
- **Token overrun**: Without governor, session may exceed budgets → Mitigation: estimator + warnings; monitors stay advisory.
