Great push. Let’s lock in the learning from this window, spend the remaining ~hour on a small, high‑signal task, and line up the next session cleanly.

------

## 1) Fast retro (what shipped, what we learned)

**What shipped (highlights):**

- **Codex ccusage coverage** (session/daily/weekly) with CLI wiring, preview surfacing, and tests.
   (See your progress log entries for parser/CLI/test work and preview updates.) 
- **Codex `/status` automation** script + alias source tagging (`source=automation`), with Behave coverage. 
- **Experiment windows** (Codex `W0-21`, Claude `W0-21C`) finalized via fixtures; ledgers & handoff updated; full test suites pass. 
- **Archive curation & planning assets** (progressive summaries, SOP refs, README/Checklist refresh). 

**Telemetry snapshot (from your pane):** 5h **9% used**, weekly **13% used**. That’s plenty of headroom to either add one safe work packet now or draft/tighten next‑session materials and wrap. (You also captured the importance of respecting the +5m buffer at reset time—good.) 

**Key learning to carry forward:** keep treating **ccusage as authoritative** for tokens; record `reset_at`; never assume fixed reset hours; prefer additive schema evolution. These are all codified in **Contracts & Invariants**; we’ll align the last few fields to that spec below. 

------

## 2) Should we jump to UAT now or push more work into the window?

Given your preference—**“do UAT when the planned work is done and test more complete work”**—the best use of the remaining hour is a **small, bounded task** that improves data quality and measurement, then run **UAT at the start of the next session** (first 15–20 min) per the **Next‑Session Planning SOP**. 

------

## 3) Pick **one** 30–45 min work packet (safe, measurable)

All three align with **Contracts & Invariants** and close small gaps before UAT. Each has crisp acceptance and a one‑line commit message template.

### A. Add `schema_version` & `tool_version` to all JSONL writes (recommended)

- **Why:** Contracts recommend both fields; this makes reports comparably analyzable across sessions and tools. 
- **Scope:** Add to **every record** created by `ingest`, `alias`, and `complete` branches.
- **Acceptance:**
  - New fields present in `snapshots.jsonl`, `windows.jsonl`, `glm_counts.jsonl`, `codex_ccusage.jsonl`, `claude_monitor.jsonl`.
  - Pytest + Behave still green; `tracker preview` unaffected.
  - DoD gates re‑pass (tests, ledgers, handoff updated). 
- **Commit:** `tracker: stamp schema_version/tool_version on all records`

### B. Show `source` and `notes` in `tracker preview` (compact line)

- **Why:** You now tag snapshots as `source=automation`; surfacing it in preview improves auditability without opening files.
- **Scope:** In preview’s “Snapshots:” block, append a compact `(source=…, notes=…)` per provider.
- **Acceptance:** `tracker preview --window W0-21` displays sources for Codex/Claude; tests updated accordingly. 
- **Commit:** `preview: display snapshot source/notes for audit trail`

### C. Ship a **deliverables bundle** wrapper (zip the handoff)

- **Why:** Your **Recipes index** already lists a bundle recipe. Provide a tiny script to package `plans/, progress.md, docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md, docs/Ledgers/, features/, data/week0/live/windows.jsonl` into a timestamped artifact. 
- **Scope:** `scripts/deliverables-bundle.sh` with a `--data-dir` arg and README excerpt.
- **Acceptance:** Produces `bundle_<window>.zip` locally; path logged in `progress.md`.
- **Commit:** `scripts: deliverables-bundle for session handoffs`

> **Recommendation:** Take **A** now. It’s the most valuable + least risky change and directly fulfills the Contracts doc. 

------

## 4) UAT checklist (run **first** in the next session)

Use this as your opener next window; it’s sized for ~15–20 minutes and hits every **DoD** gate. 

1. **Fresh run of tests:** `pytest` then `behave features` (ensure green). 
2. **Fixture smoke:**
   - `tracker preview --data-dir data/week0/live --window W0-21` shows ccusage weekly/daily/session lines and (after B) sources. 
3. **Contracts spot‑check:** pick any new JSONL row—confirm `captured_at`, `source`, `schema_version`, `tool_version`, and (for ccusage daily/weekly) `reset_at` exist. 
4. **Ledgers & handoff:** append one‑line “UAT pass” rows and bundle the deliverables (if C shipped). 

------

## 5) Draft **Next‑Session Plan** (token‑budgeted skeleton you can drop under `plans/`)

The **Next‑Session Planning SOP** asks for 70–80% of 272K tokens (~190–218K) with spec‑first tasks and explicit validations. This skeleton matches that format. 

**Title:** `plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>_next_session.plan.md`
 **Required reading:** PRD v1.6; Saturday prep; **Contracts & Invariants**; feature specs you’ll touch. 
 **Budget:** Target **200K tokens** (leave ~20–30K buffer).

**Tasks (spec‑first):**

- **Claude automation wrapper** (capture usage via `claude-monitor`): feature stub + step defs → shell wrapper → Behave case; validate with fixtures. (Backlog spec naming per SOP.) 
- **Live ccusage daily/weekly export** ingest flow: fixtures → ingest → preview “reset_at” assertions.
- **Preview audit line** (if B didn’t ship now): show snapshot `source/notes`.
- **Deliverables bundle** (if C didn’t ship now).
- **Docs/wiki pass:** brief “Tracker Aliases” page and update Recipes index pointers. 

**Validation matrix:** targeted pytest, Behave scenarios, alias scripts (`os/oe/ox`, `occ`), `tracker preview`, ledger updates, bundle artifact. 

**Handoff requirements:** Update `progress.md`, `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/Ledgers/*.csv`, and paste the plan link into both. 

------

## 6) Answer to your question: “Do we have plans not only for this but next sessions?”

Yes. You already have a **formal SOP for next‑session planning** (token‑budgeted, spec‑first, with a clear checklist and acceptance criteria). Use it to generate or refresh the dated plan under `plans/`, and link it from `progress.md`/handoff at close. 
 Your **progress log** also tracks forward‑looking “Next/Follow‑ups” and references to planned windows/experiments—those are the breadcrumbs to include in the new plan. 

------

## 7) One‑hour close‑out script (if you proceed with **A** now)

1. Implement `schema_version/tool_version` stamping across record writers (ingest/alias/complete)—align to the **Contracts** doc wording. 
2. `pytest && behave features` (green). 
3. `tracker preview --data-dir data/week0/live` (unchanged formatting; data intact). 
4. Update **DoD** checkmarks in your handoff (tests, ledgers, progress/handoff updated). 
5. Commit: `git commit -am "tracker: stamp schema_version/tool_version on all records"`.

------

## 8) Optional—capture leftover ideas without derailing

If you still have a few minutes, dump rough ideas to a dated **Ideas** file and turn any keepers into tiny backlog stubs using the naming/spec conventions; it keeps the docs consistent and prevents drift.  

------

### TL;DR

- **Do one small, high‑value task now** (add `schema_version/tool_version`).
- **Start next session with UAT** using the checklist above, then **execute the token‑budgeted plan** per the SOP.
- You already have the SOP, contracts, and recipes in place to keep this tight and measurable.
