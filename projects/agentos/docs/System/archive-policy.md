# Archive Policy

Move completed plans, discovery notes, and historical reports into `docs/Archive/` to keep the active workspace focused.

## Rules
- Never delete executed artifacts; archive them with a `YYYY-MM-DD_` prefix.
- Treat archives as read-only. Create a new document instead of editing archived material.
- Reference archived sources via footnotes when updating active docs.
