# Deliverables Bundler 2.0 — Diff Summary Spec (Stub)

- Compare newly created bundle with previous bundle (same week) and emit markdown diff (added/changed files).
- Exclude secrets/ignored logs; diff should focus on plans, TLDRs, ledgers, windows.jsonl, preview snapshots.
- Output path referenced in session handoff (`docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`).

Detail diff tooling and formatting prior to implementation.
