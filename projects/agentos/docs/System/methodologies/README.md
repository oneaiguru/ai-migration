# Methodology Index

This index tracks the workflows we experiment with across the tracker project. Each methodology folder captures:

1. **overview.md** – purpose, scope, and entry documents
2. **metrics.md** – how we measure effectiveness for the workflow
3. **experiments.md** – links to sessions, fixtures, and tasks that exercised the method

Current methodologies:

- [tracker_alias_cycle](tracker_alias_cycle/overview.md)
- [bdd_spec_first](bdd_spec_first/overview.md)
- [churn_measurement](churn_measurement/overview.md)
- [progressive_summary](progressive_summary/overview.md)

Update this index whenever a new workflow is introduced or retired.
