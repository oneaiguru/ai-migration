# Metrics

- **Scenario coverage:** count scenarios per provider/command (tracked in `docs/Tasks/tracker_feature_log.md`).
- **Red/green cadence:** ratio of commits/tests that include both failing feature addition and subsequent pass (log in `progress.md`).
- **Execution discipline:** percentage of tracker changes with documented `pytest` + `behave` runs in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- **Fixture freshness:** number of fixtures updated per session to reflect live data.
