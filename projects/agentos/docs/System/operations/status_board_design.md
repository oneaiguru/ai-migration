# Status Board TUI — Design Notes (Stub)

Scoping decisions before implementation:
- Panels: active windows, provider efficiency (with CI/power), ccusage weekly/daily/session, reset countdowns, notes/source.
- Controls: refresh, export snapshot, quit.
- Integration: reuse preview helpers; follow UPS field names.

Update with detailed mocks before implementation.
