# AI Tool Docs

Centralized notes for third-party AI tooling we rely on. Each sub-document captures installation, CLI usage, and integration considerations so future agents can operate without ad-hoc queries.

## Contents

- [Claude Monitor Reference](claude-monitor-reference.md) — upstream README for `claude-monitor`; supplement with repo-specific SOP once parser integration lands.
- [Codex Status Refresh](codex-status-refresh.md) — notes on `/status` pane lag and ingestion requirements.
- [Codex Context Pruning](codex/context_pruning.md) — note on automatic context recovery within a live session.
- [Codex CLI Reference](codex/codex_cli_reference.md) — non-interactive mode guidance, JSON output, and session automation tips.
- [Codex Official README](codex/README.md) — upstream project overview mirrored locally.
- [Codex CLI Manual](codex/cli.md) — official CLI documentation snapshot.
- *(Add new entries as tools are evaluated.)*

Please keep copies synchronized with upstream sources and annotate repo-specific warnings directly in the related task briefs (`docs/Tasks/`).
