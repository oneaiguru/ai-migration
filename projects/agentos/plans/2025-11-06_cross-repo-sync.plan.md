# Plan — Cross‑Repo Sync (Process‑Only Slice)

## Required Reading
- `docs/integration/CROSS_REPO_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md`
- `docs/integration/CCC_AGENT_CHAT.md` (latest alignment gate)
- `docs/Tasks/integration_pipeline.md`

## Objectives
1. Adopt the cross‑repo sync protocol; no code changes in this slice.
2. Stage D+1/D+2 deliverables and acceptance in a ready checklist.
3. Confirm alternating sessions (AgentOS → CCC → AgentOS …) with small slices.

## Tasks
- Post an “alignment gate” entry in `CCC_AGENT_CHAT.md` (done) to hold coding until ACK.
- Publish this plan and link it from `progress.md` and `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- Prepare shells for D+1 deliverables (file paths, test names, doc anchors) to reduce diff churn in coding slice.

## Validation Matrix
- N/A (process slice). Confirmation is the CCP ACK to the alignment gate.

## Deliverables
- This plan, protocol doc, and backlog entry published.
- Chat log updated; waiting for ACK before coding D+1.
