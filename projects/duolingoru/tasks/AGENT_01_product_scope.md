# Task: Product scope and backlog

Goal:
- Turn the PRD into a clear MVP scope, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

Inputs:
- projects/anglo/PRD_Enhanced.md

Create these files:
- projects/duolingoru/docs/product/mvp_scope.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/product/user_stories.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/product/acceptance_criteria.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/product/roadmap_v1_v2.md

Guidance:
- Keep scope strict: v1 vs v1.x vs v2.
- Use bullet lists and simple tables when useful.
- Stories should be grouped by theme (onboarding, lessons, gamification, payments, etc.).
- Acceptance criteria should be testable and short.

Done criteria:
- Each file exists and is complete.
- No overlap with other task files.
