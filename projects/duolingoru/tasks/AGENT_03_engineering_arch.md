# Task: Engineering architecture

Goal:
- Propose system architecture, data model, and API contracts for MVP.

Inputs:
- projects/anglo/PRD_Enhanced.md

Create these files:
- projects/duolingoru/docs/engineering/architecture.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/engineering/data_model.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/engineering/api_contracts.md
- projects/duolingoru/docs/engineering/pwa_android_distribution.md

Guidance:
- Keep it implementation-agnostic but concrete (components, services, data stores).
- Data model should include users, lessons, progress, streaks, subscriptions, payments, notifications, experiments.
- API contracts should be high level: endpoints, inputs, outputs, auth.
- Distribution doc should cover PWA and RuStore path and build outputs.

Done criteria:
- Each file exists and is complete.
- No overlap with other task files.
