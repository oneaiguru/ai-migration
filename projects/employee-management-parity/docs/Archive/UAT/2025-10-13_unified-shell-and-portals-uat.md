Summary (head)
```
Unified Shell & Portal UAT Report

Right‑Track Verdict
- Unified shell looks like a single product? No — pilot URL returned 404; shell not verified.
- Top‑level semantics match real system? No — real top nav shows four modules (Прогнозы, Расписание, Сотрудники, Отчёты), not just Employees/Schedule.

Language Inventory — Employee Portal: behaviour Pass; RU labels present; no English strings found.
Language Inventory — Manager Portal: behaviour Pass; remaining English phrases noted across Dashboard/Approvals/Teams.
```

Action
- Use this as a reference for language localisation tasks and for verifying unified shell navigation against the real top bar once the pilot deploy is available.
