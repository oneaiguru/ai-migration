Here's the completed side-by-side comparison report in a Markdown file. It maps each function and page from the real
Naumen WFM system to the equivalent (or missing) features in the three Vercel demos, summarizing matches, gaps, and
key observations:

Naumen vs Demo
Schedules/Manager/Employee:
Behavioural Comparison
This report documents a side‑by‑side walkthrough of the real Naumen WFM product (via the scheduling and employees
modules) compared with three Vercel demos: Manager Portal, Analytics Dashboard and Employee Portal. Each row corresponds to a navigation path in the Naumen system as specified in naumen-real‑walkthrough.md. For each path the
table summarises what was observed in the real system, maps the equivalent (or missing) functionality in the demos and
notes whether the behaviour matches. Evidence from the session is provided via screenshot citations.

Observations and Key Behaviour Gaps
Scheduling graph functions (forecast, day/period switch, overlays) only exist in the schedule grid demo; the
Manager Portal and Employee Portal do not replicate them. Achieving parity would require adding these controls
to the demos or removing them if not needed.
Shifts, schemes, monitoring, tasks, events, vacations, employees and reports are full modules in Naumen but
completely absent from the demos. The Manager Portal aggregates team metrics but offers no ability to manage
shifts or employees; the Employee Portal focuses on personal requests.
Approvals: the Manager Portal includes a request list with priority filters; however, it lacks shift exchange requests
and bulk approve/decline actions found in Naumen’s requests module.
Profile editing: the Employee Portal’s profile form matches Naumen’s user settings, but it is accessed via a dedicated tab rather than the avatar menu; Manager Portal’s settings are undefined.
Dashboards & KPIs in demos are custom additions; they do not reflect existing Naumen behaviour, which relies
on reports for analytics. Matching Naumen would require either removing these dashboards or implementing similar modules in the real product.
Analytics Dashboard could not be assessed because the Vercel URL redirected to a protected SSO page. Without
access to a real analytics module, parity cannot be verified.

Conclusion
The scheduling grid demo now aligns closely with Naumen’s Graph page for forecast/plan behaviours, but the Manager
Portal and Employee Portal demos introduce entirely new dashboards and workflows that do not exist in the real Naumen scheduling slice. To achieve full behaviour parity, these demos would need significant adjustments: adding the full
suite of scheduling modules (shifts, schemes, requests, monitoring, tasks, events, vacations, reports and employee management) or, alternatively, clarifying that they represent conceptual extensions rather than parity targets. The provided
table and observations should help prioritise future parity work.
Feel free to review it and let me know if further refinement is needed.
