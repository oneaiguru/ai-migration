## Prior UAT Summaries (Archived 2025-10-13)

Note: These entries were provided by agents during early passes and are archived for context. Use them only as background; do not treat as verified parity evidence.

### Summary A — Modules Overview vs Demos

Below is an agent summary mapping manuals and the real Naumen WFM environment (Forecasts, Employees, Scheduling sub‑modules, Reports), contrasted with our demos. It highlights that Manager Portal/Employee Portal features do not directly map to Scheduling sub‑modules.

### Summary B — Demos Without Real Module Counterparts

Agent’s note (verbatim excerpt):

> I appreciate your concern. In our previous review, I thoroughly explored the Scheduling module of the real Naumen WFM product (График, Смены, Схемы, Исключения, Справочники, UI/UX, Сотрудники, Отчёты) and compared it against the schedule‑grid demo. That comparison achieved full behavioural parity for the covered CH5 features.
>
> For the three newer demos—Manager Portal, Analytics Dashboard and WFM Employee Portal—the situation is different:
>
> • Manager Portal & Employee Portal: These demos introduce dashboards (KPI cards, team coverage bar, request distribution pie), teams lists, approval queues and profile editing. None of those screens exist in the Scheduling slice of the real Naumen product I have access to. The live Naumen site I explored only provides scheduling tools; there is no “Manager Portal” or “Employee Portal” with dashboards, approvals or team management to use as a reference. Consequently, I cannot identify code changes that would bring these demos into parity with the schedule module because there is no equivalent feature set in that module.
>
> • Analytics Dashboard Demo: The URL provided loaded a WFM Employee Portal interface, not an analytics dashboard. I do not have access to a corresponding analytics module in the real Naumen product, so I cannot confirm parity or identify concrete gaps. Without a real benchmark, any comparison would rely solely on the CH5/CH6 documentation rather than on observed behaviour.
>
> If you want to align these demos with other Naumen modules (such as requests management or analytics), the next step is to obtain access to those specific modules in the real product or ensure the demos match the CH5/CH6 specifications. The parity packs you shared already outline what to verify and where; an agent can use those to assess the demos against the specs and note any behavioural deltas. However, until there is a real Naumen “Manager” or “Employee” module available for side‑by‑side comparison, it isn’t possible to produce a definitive list of code changes needed for 100 % parity.
