# Phase 8 – Gaps Deferred by Pilot Scope

## Summary
Based on the Trimmed Live Smoke results and Appendix 1 of the master contract, the following Phase 8 gaps are deferred as “out of pilot scope.” No functional changes are required in the trimmed build.

## Deferred Items
- Bulk edit panel (Group G, IDs 42–50)
  - Reason: Pilot excludes 31–50 per Appendix 1
  - Reference: /Users/m/Documents/wfm/main/deliverables/frame-002/module-employee-management/final_package/ru/wfm_appendix_1.md
- Tag assignment limit (ID 26 — “до 4 тегов на сотрудника, жёсткий лимит”) and related tag items (27–29)
  - Reason: Pilot excludes 26–29 per Appendix 1
  - Reference: wfm_appendix_1.md
- Import/Export heading alignment (IDs 51, 56)
  - Status: Optional copy tidy; safe to defer. Both items are in pilot but non‑blocking (labels only)
  - Reference: wfm_appendix_1.md

## Notes
- If any “4‑tag limit” copy appears in the trimmed UI, consider hiding it until the tag UI lands in a future phase to avoid confusion.
- Keep the trimmed build focused on the pilot in‑scope items (e.g., import employees, import tags validation, core list/edit flows).
