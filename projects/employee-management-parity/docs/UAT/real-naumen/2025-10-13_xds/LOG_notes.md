## Real Naumen UAT – Notes (extracted)

1) Graph page (tabs, Day/Period, Σ/123, SL)
I am capturing a screenshot of the Naumen Graph page, focusing on the view tabs, day/period toggle, Sigma/Σ and 123 overlays, and the service level line with a target of 90%.

2) Graph page top layout
I'll use the computer tool to capture a screenshot of the Graph page, focusing on the top part to document the page's layout.

3) Graph page overview
I'm describing the features of the Graph page, including the top navigation options and the structural layout with date range selectors, employee lists, and a grid that shows shift times.

4) Navigate to Shifts (Смены)
I'll click on the 'Смены' (Shifts) tab to proceed with verifying features for this section.

5) Loading state
The page is in the process of loading. I'll wait for it to fully load.

6) Shifts templates + timeline
I'm on the Shifts page, where there is a list of shift templates on the left and a timeline with shift editing area on the right.

7) Loading state
The page is still loading. I am waiting for it to fully load so I can proceed with the next steps.

8) Schemes matrix
The Schemes page shows a matrix with colour-coded cells for working and off days.

9) Loading state
The page hasn't finished loading yet.

10) Requests categories
The Requests page is loaded with categories for schedule changes and shift exchanges, offering filters and bulk action buttons.
