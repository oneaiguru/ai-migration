## Docs Packet – Forecasting & Analytics Demo

Demo path: `${FORECASTING_ANALYTICS_REPO}`

Scope: documentation only; do not change code. Write in `Drafts/` and cite path:line plus CH § for every entry.

Sources:
- Demo source (read‑only): accuracy, trends, adjustments modules (`src/components/forecasting/*`)
- Contract docs: CH4 Forecasts, CH6 Reports

Order of Work:
1. Validate demo path; list screens and features per CH4/CH6.
2. Fill Code Map and Drafts using templates under `docs/Workspace/Templates/`.
3. Capture UAT slices for accuracy, trends (dual axis + confidence band), and adjustments (undo/redo).
4. Update System reports; add screenshot aliases.
5. Summarise in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

Acceptance:
- Drafts populated with path:line citations and CH refs.
- Wrapper matrix rows added for KPI/trend/adjustments.
- UAT blocks and screenshot checklist complete.
