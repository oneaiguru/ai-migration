## Metadata
- **Status**: Draft – do not execute until component-library stabilization completes.
- **Objective**: Audit the remaining AI-docs assets (reference docs, third-party repos) and update `docs/System/ai-docs-index.md` plus AI-doc READMEs accordingly.
- **Inputs**: docs/System/ai-docs-index.md, docs/Tasks/phase-7-component-library-discovery.md, docs/Tasks/phase-7-component-library-followups.md.

## Notes
- Scope includes `ai-docs/reference/docs/`, `ai-docs/third_party/`, and verifying wrapper drafts/playground demos remain in sync with production code.
- Deliverables: refreshed index entries, documented findings in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and follow-up tickets if gaps remain.

Promote this draft to a full plan once the stabilization work is merged and the executor bandwidth is available.
