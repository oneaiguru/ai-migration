Consolidated UAT – Three Demos (Employees, Manager, Analytics)

Hi — please run the checks below on the latest production URLs and reply with the Pass/Fail table (one line per check). Attach new screenshots for any Fail. I’ve attached prior artifacts where available.

Targets
- Employee Portal: https://wfm-employee-portal.vercel.app
- Manager Portal: https://manager-portal-demo-46qb9mity-granins-projects.vercel.app
- Analytics Dashboard: https://analytics-dashboard-demo-d60586nei-granins-projects.vercel.app

Packs to use
- Employee Portal: parity_static.md + trimmed_smoke.md (behaviour only; visuals frozen)
- Manager Portal: parity_static.md + chart_visual_spec.md (focus on coverage/adherence toggle)
- Analytics Dashboard: parity_static.md + chart_visual_spec.md (focus on dual‑axis trend legend/labels)

Focus checks (delta)
1) Employee Portal (EP‑1 fix validation)
   - Page: /vacation-requests
   - Action: submit one new vacation request
   - Expect: single new row added (no duplicates), the “All” counter increments by 1, no console errors
   - Attach: portal-requests-after-fix.png (previous run), add a new screenshot if anything changes

2) Manager Portal (MP‑1 toggle validation)
   - Page: Dashboard
   - Action: toggle coverage/adherence
   - Expect: two datasets visible per mode, legend/labels aligned with the toggle; RU formatting OK; no console errors
   - Screenshot: capture the dashboard chart with the toggle visible

3) Analytics Dashboard (AD‑1 re‑validation)
   - Page: Dashboard (trend analysis panel)
   - Check: dual‑axis trend shows correct primary/secondary labelling; legend items align to the right axis when `secondaryAxis` is used
   - Expect: labels and colours match, RU formatting OK; no console errors
   - Screenshot: capture the trend chart and legend
