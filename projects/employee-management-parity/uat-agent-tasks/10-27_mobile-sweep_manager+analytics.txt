Mobile UAT – Manager Portal + Analytics (2025-10-27)

Context
- Behaviour parity is green. This pass verifies responsive/mobile UX for Manager Portal and Analytics on production builds. Visual pixel-tweaks are out of scope; focus on usability, layout integrity, and RU copy not breaking layouts.

Targets (Production)
- Manager Portal: https://manager-portal-demo-46qb9mity-granins-projects.vercel.app
- Analytics Dashboard: https://analytics-dashboard-demo-d60586nei-granins-projects.vercel.app

Devices/Breakpoints (use browser devtools responsive mode)
- iPhone 12/14 (390×844 @3x)
- Android Pixel 5 (393×851 @2.75x)
- iPad (768×1024)
- Small laptop (1280×720) for narrow desktop sanity

Checklist (run on both targets)
1) Global/nav
   - Header collapses properly; hamburger opens/closes drawer; focus trap works; ESC closes.
   - No layout shifts on open; body scroll locks while drawer/modal open.
   - No horizontal page scroll at rest (except data tables with intended overflow).
2) Charts (Line/Bar)
   - Canvas resizes without clipping; legends wrap; long RU labels don’t overlap.
   - Toggles/buttons reachable and tappable; tooltips visible and not off‑screen.
   - No console errors while interacting.
3) KPI tiles/cards
   - Wrap to 1–2 per row; numbers readable; RU units/labels not truncated.
4) Tables/dialogs
   - Tables allow horizontal scroll; headers remain visible; filter chips wrap and are tappable.
   - Dialogs (approvals/details) fit viewport height; content scrolls inside; close button works.
5) Forms/filters
   - Date/number pickers usable by tap; no cut‑off popovers; Russian locale preserved.

Reporting – paste in consolidated table
| App | Device | Page/Area | Pass/Fail | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Add 2–3 screenshots per app covering: nav closed/open, chart view, table/dialog. Name files per docs/SCREENSHOT_INDEX.md (e.g., mp-mobile-nav.png, mp-mobile-chart.png, ad-mobile-chart.png).

Acceptance
- All checklist items Pass on both apps across listed devices OR failures noted with screenshots and short notes.
- No console errors during interactions.
- If any Fail: paste a one‑line proposed fix in Notes (e.g., reduce gap, enable table overflow-x, wrap legend).
