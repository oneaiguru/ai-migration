=== Demo Under Test ===
- Forecasting & Analytics demo (React 18.3.1 deploy): https://forecasting-analytics-p6z0l224h-granins-projects.vercel.app

=== References ===
- Manual crosswalk: uat-agent-tasks/manual_forecasting-analytics-crosswalk.md (maps each demo route to CH4 images)
- Behaviour packs: docs/Tasks/uat-packs/parity_static.md and docs/Tasks/uat-packs/chart_visual_spec.md
- Attached screenshots (manual_* and playwright_* files) show the expected production behaviours for quick comparison.

=== Focus Checks (delta) ===
1. FA‑1 — Trends: confidence band + secondary axis legend
   - Demo page: /trends (Strategic/Tactical/Operational)
   - Compare with real system (manual images `image27.png`, `image28.png`).
   - Expect shaded confidence band around the forecast series, legend labels for secondary-axis series, no console errors.
2. FA‑2 — Manual Adjustments: inline status badges + undo/redo
   - Demo page: /adjustments
   - Compare with the production forecast table (manual image `image80.png`).
   - Expect bulk +10 to show “Сохранено/OK” badges, undo restores baseline, redo re-applies; console clean.
3. Accuracy dashboard overview
   - Demo page: /accuracy
   - Compare with the production forecast analysis view (manual image `image60.png`).
   - Expect KPI deck + error analysis toggles with RU formatting (comma separators); console clean.

=== Reply Format ===
| Check | Pass/Fail | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FA‑1 trends confidence band + legend |  |  |  |
| FA‑2 adjustments badges + undo/redo |  |  |  |
| Accuracy KPI + error analysis |  |  |  |

Please note any extra findings (e.g., RU localisation, missing import/export flows) under “Notes.” Attach new screenshots only for failures; otherwise the baseline images suffice.

Thanks!
