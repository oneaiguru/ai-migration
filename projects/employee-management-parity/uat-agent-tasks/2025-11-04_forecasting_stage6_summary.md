I loaded the latest demo `forecasting‑analytics‑d985qxj4y` and systematically walked through each module, comparing the UI/behaviour to the real Naumen forecasting screenshots. Because our current credentials expose only the basic Build/Absenteeism pages in the live portal, I relied on the illustrated kit to verify the remaining features.

| Area | Environment | Pass/Fail | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell timezone selector | Demo | **Pass** | The header includes a timezone drop‑down (e.g., “Москва (UTC+03)”) and update status, plus modules for Build, Exceptions, Trends, Absenteeism, Accuracy and Adjustments. Selecting another timezone (e.g., UTC+03) updates date pickers without affecting the bell or user menu. This matches the production screenshot of a complete forecasting shell. | `forecasting-timezone-selector.png` if needed |
|  | Real | **N/A** | Timezone selector could not be reached with the current credentials. |  |
| Build forecast workflow | Demo | **Pass** | The `/build` page contains a hierarchical queue tree with search and parent/child counts, history horizon cards (30 days/15 min, 60 days/sutki, etc.), editable start/end times for history and forecast, an absenteeism panel with profile chips and a custom value field, and action buttons to run/export/import forecasts. A summary banner appears after running the forecast. These elements align with the illustrated build page. | — |
|  | Real | **Partial** | With the accessible login we saw queue tree + date pickers but not the additional horizon cards/toasts shown in the kit. |  |
| Exceptions wizard | Demo | **Pass** | The `/exceptions` page lists saved templates and lets users create new ones by mixing single dates and repeating intervals via a Day/Interval toggle. History periods can be chosen (30/60/90 days or custom), and there are CSV import/export buttons and a save/reset panel. This matches the production period‑builder screenshot. | — |
|  | Real | **Partial** | Current access surfaced Day/Interval toggles + date pickers only; smoothing sliders/import/export were not visible. |  |
| Absenteeism history | Demo | **Pass** | The `/absenteeism` page displays saved profiles and a detailed editor (name, coverage, average value, periodic rules, one‑off overrides). At the bottom, an “Absenteeism calculator” selects a profile and queue, with scenario chips and a “Рассчитать” button. This matches the reference absenteeism banner and history table. | — |
|  | Real | **Partial** | We observed the banner + run-history table, but scenario chips/queue selector were not accessible under this login. |  |
| Trend analysis tables | Demo | **Pass** | The `/trends` module provides Strategic/Tactical/Operational tabs with period pickers, a queue selector, and charts for “Прогноз vs факт” (with a confidence band and dual‑axis legend), “Сезонность по часам” and an “Оперативное окно”. A context panel shows organisation, queue and period; an anomalies panel lets users flag spikes. This matches the production charts and equal‑period selector in the kit. | — |
|  | Real | **N/A** | Trend analysis section was not accessible with current credentials. |  |
| Accuracy detail table + export | Demo | **Pass** | The `/accuracy` dashboard displays KPI cards (MAPE, MAE, RMSE, Bias, R²) using comma decimals and a non‑breaking space before “%”, a confidence‑interval widget, sample size and p‑value. The table lists forecast, fact, absolute/relative deviation, absenteeism, lost calls, AHT and SL; a metric selector and period dropdown are provided. This matches the illustrated accuracy detail table from the reference kit. | `forecasting-accuracy-detail.png` |
|  | Real | **N/A** | Accuracy dashboard could not be reached with current credentials. |  |
| Manual adjustments | Demo | **Pass** | The `/adjustments` page shows an interval grid with forecast, correction, total, required agents, confidence % and status. Selecting multiple rows and clicking “+10” applies corrections and displays “Выбрано” badges; undo/redo controls restore or reapply values. A warning notes adjustments above ±20 % require review. This behaviour mirrors the production adjustments grid. | — |
|  | Real | **N/A** | Manual adjustments area was not accessible during this pass. |  |
| Reports bell / downloads | Demo | **Pass** | The demo’s Reports catalogue (via `/reports`) lists report names (e.g., T‑13 tabell) and allows CSV/XLSX/PDF exports. Downloads appear in the bell queue with RU timestamp formatting. This corresponds to the production reports list. | — |
|  | Real | **Partial** | Report downloads/notifications are available elsewhere in the production portal; forecasting-specific cards were not exposed to this login. |  |

**Summary**

This Stage 6 parity sweep confirms the new demo matches the illustrated production behaviour across all forecasting modules. The build, exceptions, absenteeism, trends, accuracy and adjustments pages replicate the layouts and controls seen in the reference screenshots, including RU localisation (comma decimals, non‑breaking spaces) and CSV import/export actions. Observed gaps stem from the limited access level in the live portal rather than demo omissions; once broader credentials are available we can extend the comparison.
