Consolidated UAT — Demos (Employees, Manager, Analytics)

Instructions
- Behaviour‑only UAT (no pixel checks). Use the URLs below; report console errors.
- Paste back the Pass/Fail table (one row per check). Attach a screenshot for any Fail.

Targets
- Employee Portal: <EMPLOYEE_PORTAL_URL>
- Manager Portal: <MANAGER_PORTAL_URL>
- Analytics Dashboard: <ANALYTICS_URL>

Packs to use
- Employee Portal: parity_static.md + trimmed_smoke.md
- Manager Portal: parity_static.md + chart_visual_spec.md
- Analytics: parity_static.md + chart_visual_spec.md

Focus checks (delta)
1) Employee Portal — duplicate submit fix
   - /vacation-requests → submit one new request
   - Expect: single new row; All count +1; no console errors
2) Manager Portal — coverage/adherence toggle
   - Dashboard → toggle coverage/adherence
   - Expect: two datasets per mode; legend/labels aligned; RU OK; no console errors
3) Analytics — dual‑axis trend legend/labels
   - Trend panel → verify primary vs secondary labels; legend items align to data‑axis
