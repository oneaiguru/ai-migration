# Parity Backlog Pointer

Phases 1–5 remain captured in `docs/Archive/Tasks/00_parity-backlog-and-plan.md`. Keep this stub so historical references still resolve.

- For current workstreams, start in `PROGRESS.md`, the relevant task spec in `docs/Tasks/`, and the active plan under `plans/`.
- When you update Phase 1–5 history, edit `docs/Archive/Tasks/00_parity-backlog-and-plan.md` and log the change in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- New slices (Phase 6 onward) should live directly in `docs/Tasks/` with a status badge and links to the latest handoff.
