# Phase 8 Discovery – Trimmed Demo Variant

> **Status:** Not started — assign to Scout before Phase 8 execution (created 2025-10-20)

## Purpose
Document the scope, dependencies, and risks before cloning the production-ready Employee Management repo without demo-only tabs. Complete this checklist before drafting the execution plan.

Add file:line citations for each source you check.

## Trim Impact Inventory
List every component, test, script, or asset that must change in the trimmed repo. Include file:line references and note whether the item is removed, updated, or retained.

| Area | File | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation |  |  |  |
| Components |  |  |  |
| Tests |  |  |  |
| Docs/Screenshots |  |  |  |
| Deploy |  |  |  |

## Shared Asset Considerations
- [ ] Document any shared utilities or data that must stay in sync between the demo and trimmed repos.
- [ ] Identify scripts (lint, build, tests) that require updates when the tabs are removed.
- [ ] Note any screenshots or Storybook stories that need alternate variants.

## Open Questions / Risks
Track unresolved items (e.g., dual-Vercel workflow, dependency updates). Each entry should cite the relevant appendix or SOP.

## Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Update `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` with discovery findings.
- [ ] Flag blockers or follow-up tasks in `PROGRESS.md` if discovery uncovers new scope.
- [ ] Attach this document to the Phase 8 plan when it is drafted.
