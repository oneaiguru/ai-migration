# Stage 6 AI UAT Checklist (Stub)

The Stage 6 browser-agent checklist is archived alongside the latest comparison report.

- Run the scripted pass using `docs/prompts/stage-6-uat-agent.md` and `plans/05_stage6-uat-report.plan.md`.
- Archive evidence and blockers in `docs/Archive/stage-6-ai-uat/Stage-6-UAT-Report-nsp559gx9-vs-gnlqewuz2.md` and the session handoff log.
- Keep this stub so existing SOP references remain valid; do not remove it even if the archive is refreshed.

## Blocker Log
- _Add dated notes here when the browser agent hits a blocker._
