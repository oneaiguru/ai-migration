Got it. Here’s a tight, **actionable plan** to decide “ship offer now vs. work more,” using **quick visual checks + a small backtest + (optional) weather stub** — all test‑gated and low‑risk.

------

## A) Decision flow (what we do next)

1. **PR #1 — Quicklook visualization & report (no model change)**
   - Already outlined earlier; produce PNGs + `REPORT.md` from current forecasts vs 2024 actuals.
   - Purpose: *eyeball seasonality/levels* (region + top‑5 districts).
   - Gate: tests (`VIZ-001..004`) pass; CI green.
2. **PR #2 — Backtest driver + scoreboard (no model change)**
   - Add `scripts/backtest_eval.py`:
     - Re‑run forecasts with **earlier cutoff** (e.g., `--train-until 2024-09-30`) and evaluate on **Q4‑2024 actuals**.
     - Metrics: **WAPE** (primary), **SMAPE** (secondary) at **region + district**, **daily + monthly**.
     - Output: `reports/backtest_Q4_2024/scoreboard.csv` + `SUMMARY.md` (top/bottom districts, biggest month deltas).
   - Tests: files exist, schema correct, metrics computed, deterministic.
   - Purpose: *objective sanity check* before client offer.
3. **PR #3 — Weather (2022–2024) behind a flag (optional)**
   - Implement issues **WEA‑001..003** (join + features) **without changing POC output** unless `--use-weather` is set.
   - Re‑run the **same backtest** with weather features enabled → compare scoreboard.
   - Purpose: if weather gives **material gains** on Q4‑2024, we can reference this in the offer.

> **Ship the offer** after PR #1 + PR #2 are green.
>  If your friend confirms weather data is ready, do PR #3 right after; otherwise ship with the current baseline and mention weather as Phase 2.

## B) Concrete data asks (send to the client contact)

- **Weather (2022–2024):** daily temp (tavg/tmin/tmax), precipitation, snow; station IDs, coordinates; license/source.
- **Any extra waste actuals** beyond 2024 (even **1–2 months of 2023** or **some 2025**) — helps validate seasonality and a tiny forward check.
- **District mapping**: if weather stations must map to districts, provide mapping or we’ll use nearest/area‑weighted fallback.

*(Keep requests minimal; we can do useful work with only weather + 2024 actuals.)*

------

## C) What “better with more data” actually means (for you)

- **More months (e.g., 2023):** stronger seasonal signal → **lower WAPE/SMAPE** on monthly forecasts and smoother weekday patterns.
- **Weather 2022–2024:** helps explain intra‑month variation (heat/cold holidays), usually improves **daily** accuracy; monthly impact varies by region.

------

## D) Tasks for the current agent (copy‑paste)

**PR #1 (Quicklook)** — if not already started, proceed as scoped earlier.

**PR #2 (Backtest driver + scoreboard)**

- Add `scripts/backtest_eval.py`:

  - Inputs: `--actual-daily`, `--actual-monthly`, `--train-until <earlier date>`, same windows as forecast.

  - Process: run forecast with the earlier cutoff; join to actuals; compute **WAPE/SMAPE** daily & monthly at region and districts.

  - Outputs:

    ```
    reports/backtest_<cutoff>/
      scoreboard_daily.csv
      scoreboard_monthly.csv
      SUMMARY.md
    ```

- **Specs/tests**

  - `specs/bdd/features/backtest.feature` with IDs: `BT-001..004`.
  - `tests/backtest/test_backtest_eval.py`:
    - files created
    - schema: columns `[level, district, date|year_month, actual, forecast, wape, smape]`
    - determinism on fixture

- **Docs**

  - `docs/System/Quicklook.md` → add a “Backtest mode” section.

- CI unchanged; coverage must stay ≥85%.

**PR #3 (Optional — Weather behind flag)**

- Implement WEA issues (join + features; no output change unless `--use-weather`).
- Extend `backtest_eval.py` to compare `baseline` vs `weather` runs; write a **side‑by‑side** scoreboard with ΔWAPE columns.

------

## E) Go/No‑Go checklist before sending the offer

-  **PR #1** merged: PNGs + visual quicklook look sane (no obvious level shifts).
-  **PR #2** merged: Backtest **Q4‑2024** shows reasonable error (e.g., monthly region **WAPE ≤ ~10–15%**, districts **≤ ~15–20%**; adjust to your risk tolerance).
-  If available: **PR #3** shows improvement with weather on daily metrics (any material gain ≥ **1–2 pp WAPE** is a good sales point).
-  CI is green (tests/spec‑sync/docs‑check/coverage).
-  You’re comfortable with screenshots from Quicklook + 2–3 sentences from SUMMARY.md to include in the proposal.

------

## F) (Optional) Short RU reply you can send later

You said English here until you ask otherwise, so I won’t draft RU text now.
 If you want, say the word and I’ll give you a 3‑line Russian reply covering: POC meaning, “yes, we already computed forecasts for chosen 2025 windows,” and “we can use your 2022–2024 weather data either in Phase 2 or as an optional add‑on.”

If this plan works, I’ll package the **PR #2 brief** for the agent next (file list, specs, tests, and acceptance).
