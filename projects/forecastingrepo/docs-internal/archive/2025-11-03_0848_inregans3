**Reasoning for Changes**
You asked whether we really need the two **missing research files** and, if yes, to provide them now in our standard multi‑file update format. Yes—both files are needed to keep the **docs index complete** and to give the team a starting point for citations and curated links. Below I provide:

* `docs/research/bibliography.bib` — a usable starter BibTeX with core, stable sources (reconciliation, baselines, competition results, ML baselines, deep nets, metrics).
* `docs/research/links.csv` — a curated link table (query/title/url/source_type/included/reason) you can grow over time.

No code behavior changes—docs only.

## Next step for the coding agent (docs‑only import PR)

1. **Proceed with the docs import exactly as planned**, and include these two files so `docs/System/documentation-index.md` has no dead links:

   * `docs/research/bibliography.bib`
   * `docs/research/links.csv`

2. **Update nothing else** (no code changes). Ensure:

   * `docs_check` passes (index links resolve),
   * `spec_sync` unchanged,
   * Coverage gates unaffected.

3. **PR title:** `docs: import research set + complete index (no behavior changes)`
   **Acceptance:** CI docs check green; no Python code modified.

---

## After that

* **PR #9** (backtest driver) — finish CI (green) and merge.
* **Docs PR:** `docs/SOP/review-bundle.md` (optional but recommended; we can supply the file text if you want it in this same format).
* **Offline A/B PR:** add the small local CLI when you’re ready to run correlations on your local zips; still **no forecast changes**.

If you prefer, I can also hand you `docs/SOP/review-bundle.md` content now in the same multi‑file format—just say the word.
