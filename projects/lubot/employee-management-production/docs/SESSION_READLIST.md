# Session Readlist

Use this checklist to prime a fresh session before touching code or plans. Review each item in order.

1. `PROGRESS.md`
2. `docs/System/context-engineering.md`
3. Role-specific CE prompt (`SIMPLE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` + Scout/Planner/Executor prompt under `/Users/m/Documents/replica/orchestrator/argus/imports/code/CE_MAGIC_PROMPTS/`).
4. Active plan in `plans/` (see `PROGRESS.md` for filename and role).
5. Supporting SOPs referenced by the plan (e.g., `docs/SOP/plan-execution-sop.md`).
6. Discovery or task docs tied to the plan (e.g., `docs/Tasks/phase-6-*.md`, AI-doc citations).
7. `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for the latest verification notes and outstanding items.

Archive note: detailed historical backlog lives in `docs/Archive/Tasks/00_parity-backlog-and-plan.md`.
