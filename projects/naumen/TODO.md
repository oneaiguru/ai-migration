# Repo Housekeeping TODO

- [ ] Remove `~/git/client/naumen_incomplete/` (leftover aborted clone) once verified no data needed.
- [ ] Decide fate of `~/git/client/employee-management-demo/` (legacy snapshot); archive or delete after confirming no references.
- [ ] Mirror agent parity report into `employee-management/docs/` when available for completeness.
- [ ] Replicate parity-plan + handoff pattern for other demos (employee-portal, forecasting-analytics, reports-analytics, schedule-grid, etc.).
