# Screenshot Index – Employee Management Parity

The local references now live under `docs/reference/screenshots/` with four subdirectories:

- `priority-in-progress/` – unique shots the next agent should consult while finishing parity gaps.
- `priority-achieved/` – reference evidence for flows we already aligned; keep handy for regressions.
- `future-scope/` – real-product screens outside the current employee module (keep for roadmap context).
- `additional/` – duplicates or alternative angles that are rarely needed; dip in only if a detail is missing from the primary sets.
