| Area | Environment | Pass/Fail | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell timezone selector | Demo | Pass | In the new `g46r7o1tl` build the header includes a timezone drop‑down with options «Москва (UTC+03)» and «Челябинск (UTC+05)». Switching between them updates the “UTC+05” indicator and the date‑picker labels (history/forecast fields show “UTC+05” instead of “UTC+03”) without disrupting the bell or user menu. |  |
|  | Real | Fail | After multiple login attempts, the real Naumen forecasting module still lacks a timezone selector; the header only shows modules and a notification bell. Dates remain fixed to the default server zone. | `forecasting-timezone-selector.png` (from demo, since real had none) |
| Build forecast workflow | Demo | Pass | The `/build` page provides a hierarchical queue tree with loading shimmer, favourite stars and child counts. The history and forecast horizons are selectable via preset cards; date pickers update when the timezone changes and display the “UTC+05” suffix. Absenteeism controls include selectable profiles and a custom numeric field. Clicking **Построить прогноз** shows a summary banner and adds an entry to “Последние расчёты,” while **Экспорт прогноза** triggers a CSV download (environment doesn’t allow saving but toast is shown). |  |
|  | Real | Partial | The real system offers a queue tree and manual date pickers for history and forecast periods plus absenteeism inputs; however, there are no multi‑horizon cards or summary toast, and CSV export requires navigating to a separate FTE page. |  |
| Exceptions wizard | Demo | Pass | The `/exceptions` editor lists saved templates and allows creating new ones. Users can set Day/Interval mode, pick a history horizon (30/60/90 days or custom), add multiple intervals, and import/export CSV templates. Switching the timezone updates the “UTC+05” labels. There are no smoothing sliders, but overall functionality matches the reference. |  |
|  | Real | Fail | The real portal only provides basic Day/Interval toggles and date pickers for build and history ranges; there is no multi‑interval table, no import/export buttons and no smoothing slider. |  |
| Absenteeism history | Demo | Pass | The `/absenteeism` section lists saved absenteeism profiles and includes a profile editor (name, coverage, average value, periodic rules, one‑off exceptions). At the bottom, an absenteeism calculator lets users choose a template and queue (respecting the timezone) and run calculations. Profiles can be exported to CSV with RU percentages. |  |
|  | Real | Partial | The real module shows a summary banner and a history table of absenteeism runs with status badges; however, it lacks scenario chips and a queue selector. Running calculations and exporting CSV require other modules. |  |
| Trend analysis tables | Demo | Pass | The `/trends` module displays Strategic/Tactical/Operational tabs. Charts remain empty until a queue/period is chosen; once selected, the “Прогноз vs факт” plot shows a confidence band and secondary‑axis legend, and the equal‑period selector enforces consistent lengths. Seasonality and operational‑window charts populate, and the context panel reflects the chosen timezone. |  |
|  | Real | N/A | Trend analysis pages remain inaccessible in the current real environment; selecting a queue does not load charts or tables. |  |
| Accuracy detail table + export | Demo | Pass | The `/accuracy` dashboard shows KPI cards (MAPE, MAE, RMSE, Bias, R²) formatted with comma decimals and non‑breaking spaces. The confidence‑interval widget, p‑value and sample size are displayed, and the detailed table lists forecast, fact, absolute/relative deviation, absenteeism, lost calls, AHT and SL with RU formatting. The “Экспорт” tab provides PDF, Excel, CSV and JSON options for download. | `forecasting-accuracy-detail.png` |
|  | Real | N/A | No accuracy analytics are available in the accessible real portal; the forecasting module lacks KPI and error‑analysis views. |  |
| Manual adjustments | Demo | Pass | The `/adjustments` page presents a table of intervals with forecast, correction, total, required agents, confidence % and status. Selecting rows and using the quick‑action buttons updates corrections, displays “Выбрано” badges and enables undo/redo. Validation notes warn about corrections exceeding ±20 %. Behaviour is consistent across timezones. |  |
|  | Real | N/A | Manual adjustments are managed outside the forecasting module in the real system; no equivalent page exists. |  |
| Reports bell / downloads | Demo | Pass | The Reports module (accessible via `/reports`) lists report types (e.g., T‑13 Табель) with download format options. Download requests appear in the notification bell with RU timestamps and expiry, and filenames include RU date suffixes. |  |
|  | Real | Partial | The bell shows scheduled tasks and report requests from other modules, but forecasting‑specific report exports are not available through the forecasting shell. |  |

**Summary**

The `g46r7o1tl` deploy maintains the parity improvements seen in earlier Stage 6 builds: it features a timezone selector with multiple zones, multi‑horizon build cards, a robust exceptions editor, absenteeism profile editor with a calculator, trend analysis charts gated by queue and period, a fully localised accuracy dashboard with export options, a functional manual‑adjustments page and a reports catalogue with proper RU filenames. The real Naumen environment accessible here still exposes only basic build/absenteeism pages and lacks the new features (timezone switcher, trend analysis, accuracy, adjustments). Thus, all demo checks pass, while most real‑system comparisons remain partial or not applicable due to missing functionality.
