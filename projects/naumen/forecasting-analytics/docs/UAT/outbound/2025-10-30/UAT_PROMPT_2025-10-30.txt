2. Demo under test
   - Forecasting & Analytics parity build (2025-10-30)
   - Production deploy: https://forecasting-analytics-oyldslume-granins-projects.vercel.app

=== Instructions ===
Behaviour-only UAT (no pixel diff). Use the deploy above, report console errors, and follow the packs listed. Cross-check against the real Naumen portal after each major step and note any behavioural or localisation deltas.

Run these packs end-to-end:
- docs/Tasks/uat-packs/parity_static.md — Forecasting & Analytics section.
- docs/Tasks/uat-packs/chart_visual_spec.md — Forecasting charts focus.

Focus checks / deltas to log explicitly:
1. FA‑1 — Trends: confidence band + secondary axis legend
   • Page: /trends
   • Expect: shaded confidence band around the forecast line, legend labels include the secondary axis (“Отклонение, %”), console clean.
2. FA‑2 — Manual adjustments: inline status badges + undo/redo
   • Page: /adjustments
   • Expect: bulk +10 applies badges, undo/redo restores baseline, validation status chips progress idle → pending → saved, no errors.
3. Accuracy dashboard overview
   • Page: /accuracy
   • Expect: KPI deck and error-analysis toggles render with RU formatting (comma decimals, non-breaking space before %), no console errors.

Return findings in the table below (add extra rows if packs reveal more issues):
| Check | Pass/Fail | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FA‑1 trends confidence band + legend |  |  |  |
| FA‑2 adjustments badges + undo/redo |  |  |  |
| Accuracy KPI + error analysis |  |  |  |

If any new issues surface while running parity_static/chart_visual_spec, append rows and mark them clearly (e.g., “Parity static – Build queue tree”).

=== Attachments ===
- None (upload screenshots only when documenting failures).

When finished, paste the completed table + narrative notes and mention any screenshots you upload.
