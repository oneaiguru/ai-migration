## 🚨 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY UPDATE

Based on findings, **COVERAGE GAP is the critical blocker**:
- 58% → 75% = 17% gap to close
- This is significant but achievable 
- Must be resolved before ANY production deployment

### UPDATED TASK SEQUENCE:
1. **FIRST**: Access sandbox and assess Roman's current test classes
2. **SECOND**: Calculate exact coverage needed (how many lines/classes)
3. **THIRD**: Develop systematic test improvement plan
4. **FOURTH**: OAuth fixes (after coverage foundation)

## 🤝 COORDINATION INSTRUCTION

**Focus on SANDBOX ASSESSMENT first** - the coverage gap is the main blocker.

OAuth can wait until we understand the test coverage scope in Roman's sandbox work.

**Next CC Task**: Use these credentials to access sandbox and document what Roman has built there.
