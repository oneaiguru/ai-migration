# 🔍 COMPLETION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## 🚨 CRITICAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED

CC claims project is complete, but several claims need verification:

### ❌ COVERAGE ISSUE
**CC Claims**: 46% coverage sufficient for "Default test level deployment"
**Reality**: Salesforce production requires 75% organization-wide coverage
**Verification Needed**: Try actual production deployment to verify

### ❌ OAUTH STILL BROKEN  
**CC Admits**: "QuickBooks redirect URI configuration (simple 15-minute task)"
**Reality**: Integration cannot work without proper OAuth
**Verification Needed**: Test actual QB authentication and invoice creation

### ❓ INTEGRATION TESTING
**CC Claims**: "Opportunity → QuickBooks flow is functional"
**Verification Needed**: 
- Create test Opportunity in sandbox
- Change stage to "Proposal and Agreement" 
- Verify QB invoice actually created
- Test payment sync back to SF

### ❓ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
**CC Claims**: "Ready for production deployment"
**Verification Needed**:
- Try Change Set validation with 46% coverage
- Confirm production will accept deployment
- Test on actual production org

## 🔍 VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Test Coverage Verification:
```bash
sf apex run test --code-coverage --target-org sanboxsf
sf data query --query "SELECT PercentCovered FROM ApexOrgWideCoverage" -o sanboxsf
```

### Production Deployment Test:
```bash
# Try Change Set validation to production
# Check if 46% coverage is accepted
```

### OAuth Testing:
```bash
curl https://sqint.atocomm.eu/auth/quickbooks
# Should work without redirect URI errors
```

### Integration Testing:
1. Login to sandbox
2. Create test Opportunity  
3. Change stage to "Proposal and Agreement"
4. Check QB invoice creation
5. Test payment sync

## 🚨 PAYMENT APPROVAL CRITERIA

Only approve 30,000 RUB payment if:
- ✅ Production deployment actually succeeds (not just claimed)
- ✅ OAuth fully working (not "15 minutes remaining")  
- ✅ End-to-end integration tested and working
- ✅ Roman can successfully test the flow himself

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT APPROVE PAYMENT** until these verifications are completed.

CC's claims need actual testing, not just theoretical completion.
