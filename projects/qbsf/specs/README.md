# 📋 Specs - AI Coding Plans

## SyncFlow (Ralph Loop)
Primary product spec: `~/Downloads/qbsfsaas.md` (referenced, not copied). Use it as the source of truth for the SyncFlow micro-SaaS. Existing files in this folder are legacy integration specs and should be referenced only when explicitly needed.

This folder contains **detailed specifications and plans** for the Salesforce-QuickBooks integration project. These are the blueprints that enable AI coding tools to execute massive amounts of work in single focused sessions.

## 🎯 Core Principle

**"The plan is the prompt and great planning is great prompting."**

Great specifications enable AI tools to scale up what they can accomplish by providing comprehensive, detailed plans.

## 📁 What's Inside

### **Feature Specifications**
