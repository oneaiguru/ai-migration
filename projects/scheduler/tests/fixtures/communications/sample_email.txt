Hi there,

I reviewed the initial designs you sent over. I like the overall direction, but I have a few concerns about the mobile layout. The navigation seems crowded on smaller screens.

Could we schedule a call this week to discuss some alternatives? I'm available Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning.

Also, what's the timeline for the next milestone?

Thanks,
John
