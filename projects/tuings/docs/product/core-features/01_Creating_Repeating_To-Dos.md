# Creating Repeating To-Dos

Let Things remind you of anything that you need to do every few days, weeks, or months.



Repeating to-dos help you manage your daily, weekly, and monthly routines by automatically creating new to-dos for you. You set their schedule once, and then leave the rest to Things – the app will remind you when the day comes by putting a new to-do in your **Today** list.

## Create a repeating to-do

1. On your Mac, open **Things**.
2. Click **File** → **New Repeating To-Do**.
3. Set the pattern: to-dos can repeat according to a fixed schedule or after the previous to-do has been completed.
4. Click **OK** to save it.

You can also make an existing to-do repeat. Select it, and then in the menu bar at the top of your screen, click **Items** → **Repeat**.

When you set up a repeating to-do, you have two additional options:

- Add a **Reminder** if you want to be notified at a specific time on the days the to-do repeats.
- Add a **Deadline** if you want each copy to have a deadline. You can also choose how many days before the deadline you want the to-do to appear in **Today**.

## Make a project repeat

If you have a list of to-dos which need to be repeated, you could [create a repeating to-do](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803564/#foczq)with a checklist – or you could create a repeating project. If a repeating project better suits your needs, here’s how to create one:

1. On your Mac, open **Things**.
2. In the sidebar, click one of your **Projects**.
3. At the top of the window, next to the project’s title, click → **Repeat**.
4. Set the pattern: projects can repeat according to a fixed schedule or after the previous to-do has been completed.
5. Click **OK** to save it.

## Repeat on certain days only

If you want to repeat something only on certain days – only weekdays, for example, or only weekends – here’s how to set this up:

1. On your Mac, open **Things**.
2. Click **File** → **New Repeating To-Do**.
3. Set **Repeat** to **weekly**.
4. Use the **+** button to add all the days on which you want the to-do to appear.
5. Click **OK**.

## Edit or stop repeating to-dos/projects

When you create a repeating to-do or project, a *template* is created. Future copies of the repeating item that appear in the **Today** list are all based on this template. If you ever want to modify its schedule or change what the to-do will look like in the future, you will need to edit this template. Here’s how:

1. On your Mac, open **Things**.
2. Locate the template.
   In **Quick Find**, type “repeating” and select **Repeating** from the results.
3. Double-click your template to make any of the following changes:
   - Edit its title, notes, tags, or checklist. Going forward, all future copies will include these changes.
   - Change its repeating pattern: click **Repeat** → **Change**.
   - Pause it: click **Repeat** → **Pause**. It will stop generating new to-dos until you resume it.
   - Resume it: click **Repeat** → **Resume**.
   - Stop it: click **Repeat** > **Stop**. This will turn your template into a regular to-do.

## FAQ

- Can I complete a repeating to-do early?

  At this time, it’s not possible to complete a repeating to-do ahead of its schedule, but we are working on improving this down the road.

- Can I see all repeating to-dos in one place?

  Yes, there is a dedicated list for this. Just invoke **Quick Find** and type “repeating”. [Learn more](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803584/#pdtzb).

- My changes to a repeating to-do don’t stick.

  If you are making changes to a repeating to-do but the next time the to-do appears those changes are gone, you have edited the copy of the repeating to-do, not the template. In order for changes to stick and appear in future copies, you must edit the repeating template. [Here’s how](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803564/#zfxwx).

- Why can’t I check off the checklist in my repeating to-do?

  You can’t complete checklist items inside the repeating *template*, only inside the copy that appears in your Today list.
