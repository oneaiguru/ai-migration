#  Writing Notes in Things

It’s easy to add notes to to-dos and projects in Things. Although most notes will only be a line or two, others can be quite lengthy and include detailed plans, references, or brainstorms.

As a note gets longer, it becomes increasingly important to *structure* it to quickly find relevant information. Here are some ways Things can help.

## Structure notes with bullets

Bullet lists in Things are as easy to use as typing `-` followed by a space. You can use them to organize information so that it’s easier to read.

In addition to using `-` for bullets, you can also type `*`, `+`, `•` or `1.`. To indent a row, simply put the cursor in front of the bullet and hit the Space key, or use ⌘ Cmd ] on Mac and iPad & Vision.

Keyboard shortcuts are localized. Please look up the correct combination for your keyboard’s language here: [Mac](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/) and [iPad & Vision](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2939808/).

## Style text with Markdown

You can format the text in the notes section to make it ***\*bold\**** or **italic**, or to ::highlight:: phrases that deserve extra attention. In long notes, add structure with **#Headings**.

*Markdown* is a bit different from the Rich Text editors (Apple Pages etc.) that you might be used to. To apply the formatting, you just need to add a few easily-accessible characters, like `*`, `:`, or `#`. Things will then turn this Markdown syntax into styled notes or checklists. The special characters will remain visible, making it easy for you to edit them later on.

### Use keyboard shortcuts or the menu to format text

If you are used to doing everything from the keyboard, then you’ll be happy to discover that you can fall back on shortcuts, and they are the same between the Mac, iPad, and Vision. The most common ones you’ll probably already know: ⌘ Cmd I makes text *italic* and ⌘ Cmd B makes it **bold**.



Learn more about keyboard shortcuts [for Mac](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/#markdown) and [for iPad & Vision](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2939808/#markdown).

If you have trouble remembering the basic Markdown syntax, you can also use menus to style your text.

1. On your Mac, open Things.
2. Select any text inside the notes section of a to-do or project.
3. Right-click on the selection and select **Edit** → **Markdown**.

Alternatively, you can also go to the menu bar at the top of your screen and click **Edit** → **Markdown**.

## Spellcheck and Substitutions

On the Mac, autocorrect and substitutions in the notes section can be customized. Here's how:

1. Open any to-do.
2. Right-click into the notes section.
3. Select **Spelling and Grammar** or **Substitutions**.
4. Check or uncheck options according to your preferences.

On mobile devices, these settings are global and can’t be changed on a per-app basis.

If you want to write code snippets or commands in the notes and keep dumb quotes and dashes, but have smart quotes and dashes in regular text, use code fences:

## Search notes with Find in Text

With longer notes you might need some help quickly locating a specific word or phrase.

![Description...](https://culturedcode.com/frozen/2025/11/appstore-4-find-and-replace.jpg)

The content of notes was already included in searches when using [Quick Find](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803584/) → **Continue Search**. With the new **Find in Text** feature, the scope of the search is narrowed down to the note you are *currently* working on.

Of course, you can trigger **Find in Text** from the keyboard on both [Mac](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/#icjco) and [iPad & Vision](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2939808/#ezvvn). If you prefer using the menu, here’s how:

1. On your Mac, open Things.
2. Open a to-do or project.
3. Place your cursor inside the note or checklist.
4. In the menu bar at the top of your screen, click **Edit** → **Find in Text**

Hold down ⌥ Opt while in **Edit** to change the menu to **Find and Replace in Text**.
