**The basics**

Each predefined list visible in the left panel of Things can be accessed via AppleScript.

**Lists**

You can access the following lists of Things using their names:

\- list “Inbox”
 \- list “Today”
 \- list “Anytime”
 \- list “Upcoming” - list “Someday” - list “Logbook”
 \- list “Trash”

They are predefined and you may not create any new lists using the make command. Each list contains collections of to-dos.

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** inboxToDos **to** to dos **of** list "Inbox" **repeat with** inboxToDo **in** inboxToDos

--- do something with each inbox to do using inboxToDo variable

**end repeat end tell**

**Please note**: the sort order of to-dos and projects accessed using “to dos” and “projects” collections corresponds to the UI. For instance:

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** upcomingToDos **to** to dos **of** list "Upcoming" **repeat with** upcomingToDo **in** upcomingToDos

--- to-dos get sorted by start date - just like in Things UI

**end repeat end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 4

**Working with to-dos**

**Getting to-dos**

You can access all to-dos (including projects) defined in Things using the application-level collection named “to dos”. You may also use the to do’s name:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** toDo **in** to dos
 --- do something with each to do using toDo variable

**end repeat**

**set** todo_things **to** to do named "Things" **end tell**

**Getting to-dos in a specific list**

Please use the collection “to dos” of a given list:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** inboxToDo **in** to dos **of** list "Inbox"
 --- do something with each to do using toDo variable

**end repeat end tell**

**Getting project to-dos**

You can access all project to-dos using the project’s collection named “to dos”:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** toDo **in** to dos **of** project "Things"
 --- do something with each to do using toDo variable

**end repeat end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 5

**Getting to-dos in a specific area**

Please use the collection “to dos” of a given area:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** ccToDo **in** to dos **of** area "Cultured Code"
 --- do something with each to do using ccToDo variable

**end repeat end tell**

**Adding new to-dos**

Typically, you’ll create new items using the standard make AppleScript command. You may use the simple syntax to add a new Inbox to do:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬

with properties {name:"New to do", due date:current date}

**end tell**

You can also specify the container for the new to do immediately. It can be a list, a project, an area, or a contact:

**Setting properties for a to do**

Here’s how you can set the properties of a task:

Things AppleScript Guide 6

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New to do", due date:current date} ¬ at **beginning of** list "Anytime"

**set** name **of** newToDo **to** "This task has been renamed"
 **set** notes **of** newToDo **to** "http://www.cultured.com/" & linefeed & "call Werner for more details" **set** due date **of** newToDo **to** (current date) + 7 * days
 **set** completion date **of** newToDo **to** current date
 **set** tag names **of** newToDo **to** "Home, Mac"

**end tell
 tell** application "Things3"

-- adding to dos with links to files

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do with properties {name:"New to do", notes: "[filepath=/Users/bartek/ Downloads/Xcode_8_beta.xip]This is a link to Xcode 8[/filepath]"} ¬

at **beginning of** list "Today" -- adding to dos in lists

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do with properties {name:"New to do", due date:current date} ¬ at **beginning of** list "Today"

**tell** list "Someday"
 **set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬

with properties {name:"New to do for someday"} -- adding to dos in projects

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New Things feature", due date:current date} ¬ at **beginning of** project "Things"

**tell** project "Things"
 **set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬

**end tell**

with properties {name:"New Things feature"} -- adding to dos in areas

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New personal to do"} ¬ at **beginning of** area "Personal"

**tell** area "Personal"
 **set** newToDo **to** make new to do with properties {name:"New personal to do"}

**end tell**

-- adding delegated to dos

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New delegated to do"} ¬ at **beginning of** contact "Steve Jobs"

**tell** contact "Steve Jobs"
 Things AppleScript Guide 7

**end tell**

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New delegated to do"}

**end tell end tell**

**Working with projects**

**Getting projects**

You can access all projects defined in Things using the application-level collection named “projects”. You may also use the project’s name:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** pr **in** projects
 --- do something with each project using pr variable

**end repeat**

**set** pr_things **to** project "Things" **end tell**

**Adding new projects**

Please use the standard make AppleScript command. You can use the simple syntax:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newProject **to** make new project ¬

with properties {name:"New project", notes:"Tiny note"} **end tell**

**Setting properties for a project**

Here’s how you can set the properties of a project:

Things AppleScript Guide 8

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newProject **to** make new project ¬

with properties {name:"New project"}

**set** name **of** newProject **to** "This project has been renamed"
 **set** notes **of** newProject **to** “http://www.culturedcode.com/“ & linefeed & "call Werner for

more details"

**set** due date **of** newProject **to** (current date) + 7 * days **set** completion date **of** newProject **to** current date
 **set** tag names **of** newProject **to** "Home, Mac"

**end tell**

**Working with areas**

**Getting areas**

Areas are accessible using the application-level collection named “areas”. You may also use the name of the given area:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** ar **in** areas
 --- do something with the area using ar variable

**end repeat**

**set** ar_things **to** area "Private" **end tell**

**Adding new areas**

Please use the standard make AppleScript command:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newArea **to** make new area ¬

with properties {name:"New area"}

**end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 9

**Setting properties for an area**

Here’s how you can set the properties of an area:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newArea **to** make new area with properties {name:"New area"}

**set** name **of** newArea **to** "This area has been renamed" **set** tag names **of** newArea **to** "Home, Mac"

**end tell**

**Deleting areas**

Please use the standard delete AppleScript command. It will move the area to Trash.

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** anArea **to** area named "Area to remove"

delete anArea **end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 10

**Working with contacts**

**Getting contacts**

Your Things contacts are accessible using the application-level collection named “contacts”. You may also use the contact’s display name:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** aContact **in** contacts
 --- do something with the contact using the aContact variable

**end repeat**

**set** thatsMe **to** contact "Bartlomiej Bargiel" **end tell**

**Adding new contacts**

New Things contacts have to be assigned to a given contact from your Address Book right at the moment of their creation. That’s why you’re supposed to use a dedicated command “add contact named” with the Address Book name as parameter:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newContact **to** add contact named "Bartlomiej Bargiel"

**end tell**

Things will perform an AddressBook search and create a proper contact record corresponding to the address card of Bartlomiej Bargiel from the Address Book.

**Getting all to-dos and projects assigned to a contact**

Each contact object contains collections of assigned to-dos. Here’s how to use them:

Things AppleScript Guide 11

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** aContact **to** contact named "My friend"

**repeat with** aToDo **in** to dos **of** aContact
 --- do something with each to do assigned to my friend

**end repeat end tell**

**Assigning items to contacts**

Please use the “contact” property of to-dos/projects to assign them to a contact:

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** aContact **to** contact named "Somebody Else"

**repeat with** aToDo **in** to dos **of** list "Today" **set** contact **of** aToDo **to** aContact

**end repeat end tell**

**Canceling the assignment of contacts**

Please use the delete command to remove the contact from todos/projects:

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** aContact **to** contact named "My friend"

**repeat with** aToDo **in** to dos **of** aContact delete contact **of** aToDo

**end repeat end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 12

**Moving items around**

**Moving to-dos/projects between lists**

The most common operation you perform using the Things UI is moving your activities between lists.

This can be done using the “move” command and works for all to-dos and projects. You’ll only need to specify the target list to move the to do/project to:

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"New to do for today"} at **beginning of** list "Inbox"

move newToDo to list "Today"

--- this marks the project as completed

**set** pr **to** project "Things" move pr to list "Logbook"

**end tell**

**Exception: scheduling to-dos and projects**

Moving items to “Upcoming” list is not supported - Things requires all upcoming actions to get an activation date.

Please use the schedule command to schedule your to dos and projects:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** toDo **to first** to do **of** list "Inbox"

schedule toDo for (current date) + 1 * days **end tell**

The above script will set the activation date to tomorrow and put the to do to Upcoming list immediately.

Things AppleScript Guide 13

**Marking to-dos and projects as completed**

You can complete a to do/project by moving it to the Logbook list:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** pr **to** project "Things"

move pr to list "Logbook" **end tell**

but you may also want it to stay in its current list before it gets logged (see: log completed now command) - please use the **status** property of to-dos and projects then:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** toDoToComplete **to** to do named "To do to complete"

**set** status **of** toDoToComplete **to** completed **end tell**

**Marking to-dos and projects as canceled**

Moving a to do to logbook is not enough to mark it as canceled. Please use the status property of a given to do to cancel it:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** toDoToCancel **to** to do named "To do to cancel"

**set** status **of** toDoToCancel **to** canceled **end tell**

**Assigning projects to to-dos**

You can get or set the to-do’s project using the “project” property:

Things AppleScript Guide 14

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do

**set** project **of** aToDo **to** project "Things" **end tell**

**Assigning areas to projects/to-dos**

You can get or set the to do/project’s area using the “area” property:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do

**set** area **of** aToDo **to** area "Private" **end tell**

**Detaching to-dos/projects from projects/areas**

You can detach an item from its project or area using the standard AppleScript command “delete”:

**tell** application "Things3"

--- this will detach the to do from its project

**set** aToDo **to first** to do **of** project named "Things" delete project **of** aToDo

--- this will detach the project from its area

**set** aProject **to** project "Things" delete area **of** aProject

**end tell**

**Deleting to-dos and projects**

The best location for deleted items is: Trash! You can simply use the “move” command to move the items to the Things Trash list:

Things AppleScript Guide 15

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do

move aToDo to list "Trash" **end tell**

You can use the standard delete AppleScript command, too:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do

delete aToDo
 **set** aProject **to first** project

delete aProject **end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 16

**Working with tags**

**Getting all available tags**

Application object supports the “tags” collection which you can use to access all tags defined in Things:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** aTag **in** tags
 --- do something with each tag using the aTag variable

**end repeat end tell**

**Creating new tags**

Please use the standard make AppleScript command:

If a tag with the given name already exists, it will be returned.

**Getting to do/project tags**

You can use string or tag object accessors to access the tags of Things items:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** newTag **to** make new tag with properties {name:"Home"}

**end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 17

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do **of** list "Inbox"

--- output: "Home, Mac" - a string!

**set** tagNames **to** tag names **of** aToDo

--- output: a list of tag objects

**set** tagList **to** tags **of** aToDo **repeat with** aTag **in** tagList

--- do something with each tag

**end repeat end tell**

**Setting tags**

The most convenient way of setting tags for to-dos and projects is to use the “tag names” property which accepts a comma-separated string of tag names:

**Working with tag hierarchies**

You can use the parent tag property to set a parent for a given tag:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aToDo **to first** to do **of** list "Today"

**set** tag names **of** aToDo **to** "Home, Mac" **end tell**

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** homeTag **to** tag "Home"

**set** parent tag **of** homeTag **to** tag "Places" **end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 18

**Deleting tags**

Please use the standard delete AppleScript command:

**tell** application "Things3"
 **set** aTag **to** tag "to_remove"

delete aTag **end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 19

**User interface interactions**

**Getting current selected to-dos**

You can access all selected to-dos using the application-level collection named “selected to dos”:

**tell** application "Things3"

**repeat with** selectedToDo **in** selected to dos move selectedToDo to list "Today"

**end repeat end tell**

**Selecting a focus, project, area, or to do**

In order to display any list, to do, project, area, or contact in the Things UI, please use the show command:

**tell** application "Things3"
 -- switches to the proper list and selects the given to do in the list of to-dos

show to do "Write AppleScript Guide"
 -- selects the "Things" project in the left Things panel and shows its contents

show project "Things" **end tell**

**Editing a to do/project**

When adding a new to do or project, you may wish to let the user edit its details manually. Please use the edit command in that case:

Things AppleScript Guide 20

**tell** application "Things3"

**set** newTaskToEdit **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:"Please enter name"} ¬ at **beginning of** list "Today"

-- Things will switch to "Today" list and enter the edit mode

edit newTaskToEdit

-- Same with projects

**set** newProjectToEdit **to** make new project ¬
 with properties {name:"Please enter name"}

edit newProjectToEdit **end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 21

**Integration**

**Displaying the quick entry panel**

Please use the show quick entry panel command to display the Quick Entry panel.

**tell** application "Things3" show quick entry panel

**end tell**

An optional with properties parameter lets you fill the panel with given values:

**tell** application "Things3"
 show quick entry panel with properties ¬

{name:"Enter a title for this to do", notes:"Enter a note"} **end tell**

Instead of the with properties parameter, you can also specify with autofill, which will try to pre-populate the panel with information from the current application the user is running:

**tell** application "Things3"
 show quick entry panel with autofill yes

**end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 22

**Other actions**

**Emptying the trash**

Please use the “empty trash” command:

**tell** application "Things3" empty trash

**end tell**

**Logging completed items**

Please use the “log completed now” command:

**tell** application "Things3" log completed now

**end tell**

Things AppleScript Guide 23

**Example scripts**

**Importing items from a text file**

**set** myFile **to** (choose file with prompt "Select a file to read:") open for access myFile

**set** fileContents **to** read myFile using delimiter {linefeed} close access myFile

**tell** application "Things3"
 **repeat with** currentLine **in** reverse **of** fileContents

**set** newToDo **to** make new to do ¬
 with properties {name:currentLine} ¬ at **beginning of** list "Anytime"

-- perform some other operations using newToDo

**end repeat end tell**
