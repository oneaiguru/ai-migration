# Scheduling To-Dos in Things

In Things, you control when to-dos come to your attention. Curate what you see in **Today**, plan ahead to keep moving towards your goals, and store vague ideas until you have time to review them.

## The Default Lists

 Things comes with default lists that organize to-dos by *when* they can be done. Every to-do belongs to one of these lists:

![The default, date-based lists in Things.](https://culturedcode.com/frozen/2023/10/dates-alllists.jpg)



- **Today** (including the optional **This Evening** section) lists everything that needs to get done today.
- **Upcoming** contains all the to-dos you can’t work on now but have planned for the future.
- **Anytime** holds all to-dos that can be tackled “at any time” – they aren’t blocked by a lack of resources or a start date.
- **Someday** is for everything that’s not clear yet but might become actionable at a later time.

The default lists cannot be renamed, removed, or re-ordered.

## Schedule To-Dos

To add, modify, or remove dates and reminders, go through the **When** date picker. It allows you to assign to-dos to any of the default date-based lists. Here’s how to access it:

- Hit the calendar icon inside a task if it doesn’t have a date yet.
- Hit the date assignment inside the task if it’s already scheduled.
- Or select a to-do and use ⌘ Cmd S on [Mac](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/#mspww) or [iPad & Vision](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2939808/#eegtb).

The date picker offers shortcuts for **Today**, **This Evening**, and **Someday**. By selecting a start date from the calendar grid, the to-do is assigned to **Upcoming**. The **Clear** button removes any existing schedules and assigns the task to **Anytime**.

(1) Schedule an undated to-do. (2) Reschedule a to-do via natural language. (3) Remove a date-assignment.

Here are some more details on how assigning start dates affects your to-dos:

- **When can I start working on this?** That’s the question that When answers. Unlike a calendar, where you schedule your appointments for durations, a start date in Things merely indicates the day on which you want to begin work on a to-do.
- **Inactive tasks stay out of the way**. To-dos (and projects) with future start dates hibernate in **Upcoming** until their start date arrives. Then they automatically move over to **Today** to remind you something needs taking care of.

## Add Reminders

Sometimes, a gentle nudge can be helpful to remember that it’s time to begin work on a project or task. Add a reminder and receive a notification when that time arrives.

## Add Deadlines

Deadlines are added through the flag button. Contrary to start dates, which describe when you want to *begin* working on a task, deadlines define the date by which you must *finish* the to-do. Usually, deadlines are tied to external pressure, and missing them could incur negative consequences: Haven’t paid a bill? There might be late fees. Didn’t finish the report for your boss on time? It might come up during your yearly review.

Tasks with a deadline remain active in Anytime. If you need more than a day to finish them, add a start date a few days prior to the deadline. 

To assign a deadline:

- **On Mac**: Click the deadline button inside a to-do.
- **On iPad & iPhone**: Tap the deadline button inside a to-do.
- **On Mac, iPad, and Vision**: Use a [keyboard shortcut](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2785159/) or [natural language](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/9780167/).

To remove a deadline from a to-do or project, tap the deadline and hit the **Clear** button inside the date picker.

## Special Lists

In addition to the default lists, Things also has two special date-based lists that you can access via Quick Find:

- **Tomorrow** limits your focus to the to-dos you’ve planned for the next day.
- **Deadlines** shows all items with a deadline, in chronological order.

To access these lists, just type their name into [Quick Find](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803584/). You can also create a [widget](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803567)for them, or access them through a custom [Shortcut](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2955145/).
